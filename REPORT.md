# CS3035 â€“ Course Project Description

## Description of Your Project

Below, provide a short description of what your project is, how it works, and why you selected this as your project.
My project is about a budgeting app where users can see how much they are spending and how it compares to the income.
The users can provide a savings goal and can see whether they are on track or not. The users creates an account by 
providing a username and password. The user then needs to input his/her income, savings goal if they have any and the expense
type and amount. The users can then press the add button which will make the system take in their information. The 
user then needs to select the create button which will create the pie chart widget showing his/her expenses and a text view below which
displays their total income, savings goal, total expenses and whether the savings goal has been met or not. If the users
are confused about what type of expense they should be adding then there is a page for standard template which has a pre defied set of
expense types, total income and savings goal which the users can use to create the chart. The users have the option to edit/delete their 
income, savings and expense types. The delete menu is only for deleting specific expense types since the user just needs to make the 
income/savings 0 and create the chart again to load it. The users need to press the load chart button to see the pie chart 
and all the necessary information. This application saves what the user has previously put so that it becomes easier for the user to
remember what he needs to change. I selected this project because I am quite a heavy spender and I lost my track of expenses all 
the time. I always tend to go over my budget and then I have to starve a lot of the time. I do not think I have every thought about saving 
because of this problem. Therefore, I thought maybe if I create my own project then I will use it and hopoefully can track my 
spendings and spend accordingly for the future.


## Requirements

- How/What different views did you provide for some aspect of your model?
    The two different views are the drawing view or pie chart view which displays the pie chart and text
    view at the bottom which shows the total income, expense, savings goal and whether the goal has been met or not
- What custom widget did you create in your application?
    Piechart is the custom widget I have chosen. User input is used to create and manipulate this widget.
- What are the different domain objects that can be created/edited in 
your application?
 Income, Savings Goal, Expense (Expense Type, Expense Amount)
- What parts of the application/project did you find particularly challenging? 
And, what would you have liked to improve?
Definitely using FXML and linking everything. FXML really messes everything up, like my pie chart was not showing at all.
- I do not know what was going on but I had to spend almost 72 hours before I got this to work. I find that this project has some
- minor issues like some exceptions that needs to handled. I would definely work on those if I wanted to improve my project.
- Any  other comments on the course project?
 I am not sure about the quality of my project but it was definitely quite challenging and I enjoyed it a lot. Hopefully I will use
- it to keep my budget in check.
